# UI Foundations — Design System Context

This is a token-first, Figma-aligned design system. Figma owns design-variable values and bindings; UIF-VLT owns durable architecture and governance.

## Language

All documentation, code comments, commit messages, and user-facing content in
this project must be written in English. No exceptions.

## Token Architecture

Canonical flow:

```text
Core → Appearance {Brand, Scheme, Scale} → Semantics → Patterns
```

| Responsibility | Purpose | Runtime projection |
|---|---|---|
| Core | Raw reusable values | `core-primitives.tokens.css` |
| Appearance / Brand | Brand-specific visual identity | `semantics-brands.tokens.brand-*.css` (compatibility filename) |
| Appearance / Scheme | Light/dark realization | `appearance-modes.tokens.mode-*.css` (compatibility filename) |
| Appearance / Scale | Fluid/scalar endpoints | `typography-fluid.tokens.mode-*.css` (compatibility filename) |
| Semantics | Stable purpose and state roles | `semantics-roles.tokens.css` |
| Patterns | UI-specific usage slots | `patterns-ui.tokens.css` |

**Reference direction:** Patterns consume Semantics. Semantics aliases Appearance.
Appearance resolves through Brand, Scheme, and Scale and ultimately depends on
Core. Existing direct Pattern dependencies are compatibility exceptions, not a
template for new work.

Generated filenames can retain historical terminology. Use
`figma/token-projection.json` to map those files to the current Figma
responsibilities.

## Token Naming

- Pattern: `<Family>/<Variant?>/<Part?>/<Property>/<State?>`; public Runtime syntax uses the canonical `--uif-*` namespace.
- Semantic color: `Color/<Purpose>/<Role>/<State>`, for example `Color/Action/Surface/Hover`.
- States: `default`, `hover`, `active`, `focus`, `disabled` — always last. `active` is the established Runtime name for the pressed interaction.

## Token Pipeline

`figma/exports/*.tokens.json` → `npm run tokens:generate` → `dist/tokens/css/*.css`

Figma exports are the source. Generated files in `dist/` are never edited directly.

## File Locations

| Surface | Path |
|---|---|
| CSS patterns | `src/ui/patterns/*.css` |
| CSS index | `src/ui/index.css` |
| Web Components | `src/elements/*.js` |
| Web Component exports | `src/elements/index.js`, `package.json` |
| Nunjucks macros | `site/_includes/macros/ui.njk` (source; `dist/macros/ui.njk` is build copy) |
| Playground renderers | `site/assets/playground/renderers.js` |
| Docs pages | `site/patterns/*.md` |
| Playground pages | `site/patterns/*-playground.md` |
| Code Connect | `schemas/web-*.figma.ts` |
| Token exports | `figma/exports/*.tokens.json` |
| Brand compatibility projection | `dist/tokens/css/semantics-brands.tokens.brand-*.css` |

## Current Patterns

Patterns are CSS-only, stateless UI building blocks. No JavaScript required.

Label, Button (solid/outline/ghost), Input, Icon, Checkbox, Radio, Switch,
Link, Badge, Divider, Textarea, Avatar, Accordion, Tabs, Tooltip, Select,
Form (bordered/none), Form Group

## Components (planned)

Components are functional units that add state, interactivity, or orchestration
logic via JavaScript. They build on top of patterns.

Planned: Calendar, DatePicker, ComboBox, Dialog, Table

Components will live in `src/ui/components/` (not yet created).

## Pattern vs. Component

| | Pattern | Component |
|---|---|---|
| CSS | ✓ | ✓ (uses patterns) |
| JavaScript | – | ✓ |
| State | – | ✓ |
| Location | `src/ui/patterns/` | `src/ui/components/` |
| Token layer | `@layer components` | `@layer components` |
| Example | `.button`, `.input` | `<Calendar>` |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Used by | Required for |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `FIGMA_TOKEN` | `tokens:sync`, Figma MCP servers | Token sync from Figma API |
| `NPM_TOKEN` | `.npmrc`, CI publish workflow | Publishing to npm (CI only) |

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local use. Scripts that need `FIGMA_TOKEN`
will fail with auth errors if it is missing. `NPM_TOKEN` is only needed for
`npm publish`.

## Pattern Promotion Workflow

When building examples, pages, or compositions that use UI patterns not yet in
the pattern list above, follow this workflow:

1. **Detect** — After finishing the requested work, review the markup for any
   repeated UI pattern (badge, list, card, tooltip, etc.) that is not an
   existing system pattern.
2. **Report** — At the end of your response, list each missing pattern with:
   - Name and short purpose (e.g. "Badge — small status pill label").
   - Why it passes the utility test (reusable across multiple contexts).
   - Whether it is a Pattern (CSS-only) or Component (needs JS/state).
   - Which of the 10 integration surfaces are needed (Rule 8).
3. **Provide a follow-up prompt** — For each missing pattern, write a
   ready-to-copy prompt the user can paste in a new conversation to scaffold
   that pattern. The prompt should include the name, variants, token naming,
   and a reference to the example where it was first used.
4. **Do NOT auto-create** — Never scaffold all 10 surfaces in the same session
   unless the user explicitly asks. Keep the current task focused and
   token-efficient.

This keeps sessions short and gives the user control over when and how new
components enter the system.

## Icons and Functional Colors

When generating UI that includes visual indicators (checkmarks, status marks,
list bullets, badges, or decorative accents):

- Use the Icon component (`ui.icon()` macro / `.icon` class) with an icon from
  `src/assets/icons/` — never substitute a text character like "✓" or "•".
- Color icons and status indicators with semantic functional tokens:
  `--color-text-success`, `--color-text-danger`, `--color-text-brand`,
  `--color-fill-brand`, `--color-fill-success`, `--color-fill-danger`.
- Use `--color-text-on-*` tokens for text on filled backgrounds:
  `--color-text-on-brand` (on brand fill), `--color-text-on-danger`,
  `--color-text-on-success`, `--color-text-on-subtle`, `--color-text-on-active`.
  These adapt per brand and mode — prefer them over the generic `--color-text-inverse`.
- Use `--color-border-brand` for accent borders on highlighted or featured
  elements.
- Never hardcode hex colors for brand or functional meaning — always reference
  semantic tokens so values adapt across brands and modes.

## Figma Write Capability

When the user asks to create or edit content in a Figma file (slides, frames,
components, layouts), use the `use_figma` tool from the Figma power. It runs
JavaScript via the Figma Plugin API and can create frames, text, shapes,
instances, and bind variables.

- Activate the Figma power first to access `use_figma`.
- For slide decks, load `#cheatsheet-builder-rules` for layout and style rules,
  and `#cheatsheet-builder-frames` for per-frame content definitions.
- Key pattern: cards and columns in horizontal rows need
  `layoutSizingHorizontal = 'FILL'` to expand equally.

## Key Rules (from `docs/agentic/assistant-behavior-rules.md`)

- Rule 8: New patterns require all 10 integration surfaces
- Rule 9: Every pattern gets its own tokens — never reuse another pattern's
- Rule 10: Token `$ref` aliases must point to existing tokens
- Rule 11: CSS class = bare name (`.slider` not `.ui-slider`), `@layer components`, logical properties
- Rule 12: Web Components use the shared base, light DOM, semantic markup, and aligned exports
- Rule 13: Docs UI uses docs-specific CSS, not brand theming

## Governance Sources (read in this order)

1. `docs/ui-foundations-rules.md` — canonical governance
2. `docs/foundations/` — architecture decisions
3. `docs/agentic/assistant-behavior-rules.md` — agent behavior rules
4. `IMPLEMENTATION.md` — repo-specific execution

## Validation

`npm run ci:check` runs: lint → test:unit → build:all → smoke:check → tokens:validate → assets:check → rules:validate → docs:build

Rule pipeline validation checks:
- principles and heuristics exist in Kiro steering
- pattern rules cite known upstream ids
- component rule surfaces exist
- `ci:check` includes `rules:validate`
