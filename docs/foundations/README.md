# Foundations

## Purpose

Foundations docs describe the canonical token, naming, theming, parity, and
format rules that other layers build on.

This section is the developer-facing entry point for Runtime foundation
implementation. It points to the detailed foundation records instead of
repeating them.

## Foundations at a glance

Use foundations docs to understand:

1. how token layers are separated
2. how public naming is derived
3. how mode and brand context are activated
4. how generated token outputs feed patterns and components

For the repository-wide system view, start with `docs/architecture.md`.

## Token model at a glance

The current model separates context from meaning:

```text
Core → Appearance {Brand, Scheme, Scale} → Semantics → Patterns
```

Brand, Scheme, and Scale decide **how** a value resolves. Semantics describes
**what the value means** in the interface. Patterns then apply that meaning to a
specific UI building block.

Older generated filenames can remain visible for compatibility; they do not
change this architectural model.

## Recommended reading path

1. `foundation-001-token-layering.md` — token layer model
2. `foundation-002-naming-and-grouping.md` — naming structure and grouping
3. `foundation-008-mode-activation-and-consumer-control.md` — mode ownership
4. `foundation-010-implementation-and-pipeline-workflow.md` — implementation workflow
5. `docs/token-pipeline.md` — generation mechanics and output files
