# Documentation Playbook

## Purpose

This playbook explains how to consume UI Foundations documentation without
guessing which file owns which rule.

## Reading order

### Developer-first navigation (default)

`README.md` → `docs/README.md` → `docs/public-api.md` →
`docs/foundations/*` → `docs/patterns/*` → `docs/validation/*`

### Agent/contributor navigation

`AGENTS.md` → `docs/playbook.md` → `docs/foundations/*` →
`docs/principles/*` → `docs/patterns/*` → `docs/validation/*`

### Missing-reference fallback policy

If a Runtime-local reference target is missing:

1. Prefer linking to an existing Runtime page that carries the concept.
2. If no Runtime page exists, add concise implementation guidance. Public
   pages must be usable without access to private ecosystem repositories.
3. Do not leave unresolved links or infer canonical ownership from local drafts.

Supplemental context:

- `DESIGN.md` for the executive design contract
- `IMPLEMENTATION.md` for repo-specific execution guidance
- `docs/uif-governance.md` for governance consumption state
- `docs/ui-foundations-rules.md` for canonical operating rules
- `docs/token-pipeline.md` for token generation and DTCG format details
- `docs/terminology.md` for canonical terminology baseline
- `docs/canonical-reference-matrix.md` for topic-to-source traceability

## Operating model

Principles  
→ Patterns  
→ Components  
→ Tokens  
→ Validation  
→ CI

How that applies in this repo:

- **Principles** define the cross-cutting design intent.
- **Patterns** translate that intent into reusable composition rules.
- **Components** apply those rules locally in markup, tokens, wrappers, and docs.
- **Tokens** carry the design decisions through Figma exports and generated outputs.
- **Validation** checks the rule chain and technical integrity.
- **CI** runs those checks consistently.

## Agent roles

- **ChatGPT**: strategy, structure, prompts, storytelling
- **Kiro**: specs, implementation planning, Figma-to-code workflows
- **Goose**: repo audit, cleanup, validation support
- **Codex**: code changes, refactoring, scripts, tests
